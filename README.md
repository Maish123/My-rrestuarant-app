# COME ONE COME ALL TO UTAMADUNI!
My restaurant app is an online menu made for UTAMADUNI, a restaurant looking to capitalize its clientbase from Nairobi and its environs.They wanted to integrate an online platform where people would order an get their meals, while also getting the client views on how they can improve the services. The front end of the web page are made from HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap.This app incorporated the use of an API from mealDB. API fetched from "https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php"
